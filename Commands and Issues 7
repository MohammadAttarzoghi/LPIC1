Description



ext2 
second extended filesystem was developed to address shortcomings in the Minix filesystem used in 
early versions of Linux. It has been used extensively on Linux for many years. There is no 
journaling in ext2, and it has largely been replaced by ext3 and more recently ext4.

ext3         ext2 + journaling, total storage can be 1EXAByte and each file can be 16TB
ReiserFS        ReiserFS is a B-tree-based filesystem, great for large numbers of small files,journaling, no longer in active development & does not support SELinux, replaced with Reiser4.
XFS                 journaling, caches to RAM, great for uninterruptible power supplies
swap               Swap space must be formatted for use as swap space, but it is not generally considered a filesystem.
vfat                  FAT32, no journaling, good for data exchange with windows, does not understand permissions andsymbolic links
ext4                newer than ext3

fsck: If anything bad happens for your filesystem (say power suddenly goes down) you will have a corrupted file system. The
command to fix this is fsck . Technically this command is a front end for many commands
A common switch during boot is -A which tells fsck to check all file systems in /etc/fstab ordered by passno in that file
which is 6th field (File systems with passno of 0, wont be checked during the boot.
Tune2fs: This is a command to tune ext file systems. It can show information and set many options. The -l option lists the current
configs: jadi@funlife:~$ df -TH Here the -T switch make df to show the file system types an. If you need the inode data, use the -i switc
vfat file format has no inodes; there is no owner or access rights on vfat filesystems.
